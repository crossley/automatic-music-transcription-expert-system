C++ system for automatic music information retrieval built.  This code represents efforts made during a brief stint in UC Santa Barbara's Media Arts and Technology graduate program in media engineering.  The goal is to load in a single track of audio comprised of several mixed instruments, and perform automatic music transcription. This code includes "expert" modules for tempo and beat detection, as well as pitch and chord recognition.
